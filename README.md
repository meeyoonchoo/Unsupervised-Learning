**Installing the Libraries**


```python
# for basic mathematics operation 
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas import plotting

# for visualizations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')

# for interactive visualizations
import plotly.offline as py
from plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot
import plotly.graph_objs as go
from plotly import tools
init_notebook_mode(connected = True)
import plotly.figure_factory as ff


```

        


**Reading the Dataset**


```python
# importing the dataset
data = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\meeyoonchoo\Documents\BayPath\DataMining2/Mall_Customers.csv")

dat = ff.create_table(data.head())

py.iplot(dat)
```







```python
# describing the data

desc = ff.create_table(data.describe())
py.iplot(desc)
```



```python
# checking if there is any NULL data

data.isnull().any().any()
```




    False



## Data Visualization


```python
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (15, 10)


plotting.andrews_curves(data.drop("CustomerID", axis=1), "Gender")
plt.title('Andrew Curves for Gender', fontsize = 20)
plt.show()
```


![png](output_9_0.png)


* It has been shown the Andrews curves are able to preserve means, distance (up to a constant) and variances. Which means that Andrews curves that are represented by functions close together suggest that the corresponding data points will also be close together


```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (18, 8)

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
sns.set(style = 'whitegrid')
sns.distplot(data['Annual Income (k$)'])
plt.title('Distribution of Annual Income', fontsize = 20)
plt.xlabel('Range of Annual Income')
plt.ylabel('Count')


plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
sns.set(style = 'whitegrid')
sns.distplot(data['Age'], color = 'red')
plt.title('Distribution of Age', fontsize = 20)
plt.xlabel('Range of Age')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

> Here, In the above Plots we can see the Distribution pattern of Annual Income and Age, By looking at the plots, 

>> we can infer one thing that There are few people who earn more than 100 US Dollars.
>> Most of the people have an earning of around 50-75 US Dollars.
>> Also, we can say that the least Income is around 20 US Dollars.

> Taking inferences about the Customers.
>> The most regular customers for the Mall has age around 30-35 years of age.
>> Whereas the the senior citizens age group is the least frequent visitor in the Mall.
>> Youngsters are lesser in umber as compared to the Middle aged people.



```python
labels = ['Female', 'Male']
size = data['Gender'].value_counts()
colors = ['lightgreen', 'orange']
explode = [0, 0.1]

plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (9, 9)
plt.pie(size, colors = colors, explode = explode, labels = labels, shadow = True, autopct = '%.2f%%')
plt.title('Gender', fontsize = 20)
plt.axis('off')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```


![png](output_13_0.png)


> By looking at the above pie chart which explains about the distribution of Gender in the Mall
>> Interestingly, The Females are in the lead with a share of 56% whereas the Males have a share of 44%, that's a huge gap specially when the population of Males is comparatively higher than Females.


```python
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (15, 8)
sns.countplot(data['Age'], palette = 'hsv')
plt.title('Distribution of Age', fontsize = 20)
plt.show()
```


![png](output_15_0.png)


> This Graph shows a more Interactive Chart about the distribution of each Age Group in the Mall for more clariy about the Visitor's Age Group in the Mall.
>> By looking at the above graph-, It can be seen that the Ages from 27 to 39 are very much frequent but there is no clear pattern, we can only find some group wise patterns such as the the older age groups are lesser frequent in comparison.
>> Interesting Fact, There are equal no. of Visitors in the Mall for the Agee 18 and 67.
>> People of Age 55, 56, 69, 64 are very less frequent in the Malls.
>> People at Age 32 are the Most Frequent Visitors in the Mall.


```python
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (20, 8)
sns.countplot(data['Annual Income (k$)'], palette = 'hsv')
plt.title('Distribution of Annual Income', fontsize = 20)
plt.show()
```


![png](output_17_0.png)


> Again, This is also a chart to better explain the Distribution of Each Income level, Interesting there are customers in the mall with a very much comparable freqyuency with their Annual Income ranging from 15 US Dollars to 137K US Dollars.
> There are more Customers in the Mall whoc have their Annual Income as 54k US Dollars or 78 US Dollars.


```python
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (20, 8)
sns.countplot(data['Spending Score (1-100)'], palette = 'hsv')
plt.title('Distribution of Spending Score', fontsize = 20)
plt.show()
```


![png](output_19_0.png)


> This is the Most Important Chart in the perspective of Mall, as It is very Important to have some intuition and idea about the Spending Score of the Customers Visiting the Mall.
>> On a general level, we may conclude that most of the Customers have their Spending Score in the range of 35-60.
>> Interesting there are customers having I spending score also, and 99 Spending score also, Which shows that the mall caters to the variety of Customers with Varying needs and requirements available in the Mall.


```python
sns.pairplot(data)
plt.title('Pairplot for the Data', fontsize = 20)
plt.show()

sns.heatmap(data.corr(), cmap = 'Wistia', annot = True)
plt.title('Heatmap for the Data', fontsize = 20)
plt.show()
```


![png](output_22_0.png)


> The Above Graph for Showing the correlation between the different attributes of the Mall Customer Segementation Dataset, This Heat map reflects the most correlated features with Orange Color and least correlated features with yellow color.
>> We can clearly see that these attributes do not have good correlation among them, that's why we will proceed with all of the features.

plt.show()
```


![png](output_24_0.png)


> Bi-variate Analysis between Gender and Spending Score, 
>> It is clearly visible that the most of the males have a Spending Score of around 25k US Dollars to 70k US Dollars whereas the Females have a spending score of around 35k US Dollars to 75k US Dollars. which again points to the fact that women are Shopping Leaders.


```python
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (18, 7)
sns.violinplot(data['Gender'], data['Annual Income (k$)'], palette = 'rainbow')
plt.title('Gender vs Spending Score', fontsize = 20)
plt.show()
```


![png](output_26_0.png)


> Again a Bivariate Analysis between the Gender and the Annual Income, to better visualize the Income of the different Genders.
>> There are more number of males who get paid more than females. But, The number of males and females are equal in number when it comes to low annual income. 


```python
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (18, 7)
sns.stripplot(data['Gender'], data['Age'], palette = 'Purples', size = 10)
plt.title('Gender vs Spending Score', fontsize = 20)
plt.show()
```


![png](output_28_0.png)



```python

x = data['Annual Income (k$)']
y = data['Age']
z = data['Spending Score (1-100)']

sns.lineplot(x, y, color = 'blue')
sns.lineplot(x, z, color = 'pink')
plt.title('Annual Income vs Age and Spending Score', fontsize = 20)
plt.show()
```


![png](output_29_0.png)


> The above Plot Between Annual Income and Age represented by a blue color line, and a plot between Annual Income and the Spending Score represented by a pink color. shows how Age and Spending Varies with Annual Income.

## Clustering Analysis


```python
x = data.iloc[:, [3, 4]].values

# let's check the shape of x
print(x.shape)
```

## Kmeans Algorithm

**The Elbow Method to find the No. of Optimal Clusters**


```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

wcss = []
for i in range(1, 11):
    km = KMeans(n_clusters = i, init = 'k-means++', max_iter = 300, n_init = 10, random_state = 0)
    km.fit(x)
    wcss.append(km.inertia_)
    
plt.plot(range(1, 11), wcss)
plt.title('The Elbow Method', fontsize = 20)
plt.xlabel('No. of Clusters')
plt.ylabel('wcss')
plt.show()
```


![png](output_35_0.png)


**Visualizaing the Clusters**


```python
km = KMeans(n_clusters = 5, init = 'k-means++', max_iter = 300, n_init = 10, random_state = 0)
y_means = km.fit_predict(x)

plt.scatter(x[y_means == 0, 0], x[y_means == 0, 1], s = 100, c = 'pink', label = 'miser')
plt.scatter(x[y_means == 1, 0], x[y_means == 1, 1], s = 100, c = 'yellow', label = 'general')
plt.scatter(x[y_means == 2, 0], x[y_means == 2, 1], s = 100, c = 'cyan', label = 'target')
plt.scatter(x[y_means == 3, 0], x[y_means == 3, 1], s = 100, c = 'magenta', label = 'spendthrift')
plt.scatter(x[y_means == 4, 0], x[y_means == 4, 1], s = 100, c = 'orange', label = 'careful')
plt.scatter(km.cluster_centers_[:,0], km.cluster_centers_[:, 1], s = 50, c = 'blue' , label = 'centeroid')

plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
plt.title('K Means Clustering', fontsize = 20)
plt.xlabel('Annual Income')
plt.ylabel('Spending Score')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```


![png](output_37_0.png)


> This Clustering Analysis gives us a very clear insight about the different segments of the customers in the Mall. There are clearly Five segments of Customers namely Miser, General, Target, Spendthrift,  Careful based on their Annual Income and Spending Score which are reportedly the best factors/attributes to determine the segments of a customer in a Mall.

## Hierarchial Clustering

>Hierarchical clustering, also known as hierarchical cluster analysis, is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other

**Using Dendrograms to find the no. of Optimal Clusters**


```python
import scipy.cluster.hierarchy as sch

dendrogram = sch.dendrogram(sch.linkage(x, method = 'ward'))
plt.title('Dendrogam', fontsize = 20)
plt.xlabel('Customers')
plt.ylabel('Ecuclidean Distance')
plt.show()
```


![png](output_42_0.png)


**Visualizing the Clusters of Hierarchial Clustering**


```python
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering

hc = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters = 5, affinity = 'euclidean', linkage = 'ward')
y_hc = hc.fit_predict(x)

plt.scatter(x[y_hc == 0, 0], x[y_hc == 0, 1], s = 100, c = 'pink', label = 'miser')
plt.scatter(x[y_hc == 1, 0], x[y_hc == 1, 1], s = 100, c = 'yellow', label = 'general')
plt.scatter(x[y_hc == 2, 0], x[y_hc == 2, 1], s = 100, c = 'cyan', label = 'target')
plt.scatter(x[y_hc == 3, 0], x[y_hc == 3, 1], s = 100, c = 'magenta', label = 'spendthrift')
plt.scatter(x[y_hc == 4, 0], x[y_hc == 4, 1], s = 100, c = 'orange', label = 'careful')
plt.scatter(km.cluster_centers_[:,0], km.cluster_centers_[:, 1], s = 50, c = 'blue' , label = 'centeroid')

plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
plt.title('Hierarchial Clustering', fontsize = 20)
plt.xlabel('Annual Income')
plt.ylabel('Spending Score')

**Clusters of Customers Based on their Ages**


```python
x = data.iloc[:, [2, 4]].values
x.shape
```

**K-means Algorithm**


```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

wcss = []
for i in range(1, 11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = i, init = 'k-means++', max_iter = 300, n_init = 10, random_state = 0)
    kmeans.fit(x)
    wcss.append(kmeans.inertia_)

plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (15, 5)
plt.plot(range(1, 11), wcss)
plt.title('K-Means Clustering(The Elbow Method)', fontsize = 20)
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```


![png](output_48_0.png)



```python
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = 4, init = 'k-means++', max_iter = 300, n_init = 10, random_state = 0)
ymeans = kmeans.fit_predict(x)

plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10, 10)
plt.title('Cluster of Ages', fontsize = 30)

plt.scatter(x[ymeans == 0, 0], x[ymeans == 0, 1], s = 100, c = 'pink', label = 'Usual Customers' )
plt.scatter(x[ymeans == 1, 0], x[ymeans == 1, 1], s = 100, c = 'orange', label = 'Priority Customers')
plt.scatter(x[ymeans == 2, 0], x[ymeans == 2, 1], s = 100, c = 'lightgreen', label = 'Target Customers(Young)')
plt.scatter(x[ymeans == 3, 0], x[ymeans == 3, 1], s = 100, c = 'red', label = 'Target Customers(Old)')
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], s = 50, c = 'black')

plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Spending Score (1-100)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()




```


![png](output_49_0.png)


>According to my own intuition by looking at the above clustering plot between the age of the customers and their corresponding spending scores, I have aggregated them into 4 different categories namely Usual Customers, Priority Customers, Senior Citizen Target Customers, Young Target Customers. Then after getting the results we can accordingly make different marketing strategies and policies to  optimize the spending scores of the customer in the Mall.


```python
x = data[['Age', 'Spending Score (1-100)', 'Annual Income (k$)']].values
km = KMeans(n_clusters = 5, init = 'k-means++', max_iter = 300, n_init = 10, random_state = 0)
km.fit(x)
labels = km.labels_
centroids = km.cluster_centers_

```
